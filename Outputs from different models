Model Outputs : 


We implemented three machine learning models in our Akhalia Real Estate predictior and these are : 

1. Decision Tree
2. Linear Regression
3. Random Forest Regression 

And the outputs and errors are following. 


1. Decision Tree :

    Mean :  4.160676325292948
    Standard Deviation :  0.6806873886189048


2. Linear Regression : 
    
    Mean :  5.030437102767305
    Standard Deviation :  1.0607661158294832



3. Random Forest Regression : 
    Mean :  3.34648007435925
    Standard Deviation :  0.6492685319270091
    
    
THESE DATAS SHOW THAT RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION IS WORKING AS THE BEST REGRESSION MODEL IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
